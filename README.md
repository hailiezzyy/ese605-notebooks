# ese605-notebooks

This repo stores Python Notebooks containing tutorials and demonstrations that we will see in class during the 2020 Spring version of [ESE 605: Modern Convex Optimization](https://nikolaimatni.github.io/courses/ese605-spring2020/index.html).  Much, but not all, of the material here is adapted from the CVXPY [tutorials](https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/index.html) and [examples](https://www.cvxpy.org/examples/index.html).

To get started,  you will want to make sure that you have a working distribution of the latest Python 3 version (currently version 3.7) running, as well as Jupyter Notebooks.  For new users, the simplest and easiest way to get going is to [install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

For those of you who prefer to work in Matlab, please refer to [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/), and in particular the [Documentaion](http://web.cvxr.com/cvx/doc/) and [Examples](http://cvxr.com/cvx/examples/) pages for comparable material.

For those of you who prefer to work in Julia, please refer to [Convex.jl](https://www.juliaopt.org/Convex.jl/stable/), and in particular the [Tutorial](https://www.juliaopt.org/Convex.jl/stable/quick_tutorial/) and extensive examples (listed in the left hand menu) for comparable material.
